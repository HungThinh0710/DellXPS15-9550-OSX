German only: If you want to remap the right ALT+GR key to the ALT key instead of the CMD, copy com.wmchris.KeyRemapping.plist to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.wmchris.KeyRemapping.plist
  
Included Monitor Profiles:  
ICC profile for 4k screen calibrated with Spyder4Pro colorimeter and DisplayCAL. Every panel is different, so don't expect too much precision, but this profile works great for sRGB and AdobeRGB. Thanks to Dagor!
